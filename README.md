# CFG Project: BuddyWalk
=========================

BuddyWalk is a web app created by a group of CodeFirst Girls Nanodegree students for our final project on the course.

BuddyWalk responds to to a growing public mood of a lack of safety when walking alone the city. By pairing up lone walkers, BuddyWalk allows users to find safety in numbers. This buddy system is accompanied by an integrated mapping tool that clearly plots the users' journeys.

Installing / Getting started:
-----------------------------

- Install dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

- Create a root directory file entitled 'config.py' to enable the MySQL connection, with the following global variables:
  HOST = 'host'
  USER = 'user'
  PASSWORD = 'password'

- Initialise the MySQL database with 'buddywalk_database.sql'.

- Run 'app.py'.
